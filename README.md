# AI Financial Tracker 💰

**Trying to build Financial Language Passer tailored for Indian users.**

---

##  Project Overview


**AI Financial Tracker** is a Flask-based web application that helps users manage their finances through:
- Natural language transaction input
- Automated expense categorization
- Transaction tracking and analysis
- SQLite-based data persistence

---

It is a personalized financial assistant built using Python and Flask. It lets users:
- Input transactions manually or using **natural language**
- Automatically **categorize** expenses and income using fuzzy keyword matching
- Track and analyze **budgets, debts, savings**, and **goals**
- Generate **data-driven insights** using rule-based and statistical models



---
This repository includes the foundational logic for transaction categorization, which plays a central role in organizing user data for budgeting, analysis, and intelligent recommendations.
